          "Added support for creating multiple material instances from a single material identified by distinct sets of material parameters during output translation.\nThe plugin now uses a new way to identify materials (which takes distinct sets of material parameter attributes into account). As a result of this, previously configured \"replacement materials\" on the outputs will likely have to be manually reapplied after this update.\nMesh outputs now also handle the situation where both `unreal_material` and `unreal_material_instance` attributes are present correctly: `unreal_material` is used if it is not the empty string. If it is the empty string then `unreal_material_instance` is used."
